Traffic sign detection and recognition is a critical task in 
computer vision and intelligent transportation systems, 
potentially enhancing road safety and optimizing traffic 
management. In recent years, significant progress has been 
made in this field, thanks to advancements in machine 
learning algorithms and the availability of large-scale 
annotated datasets. This paper focuses on implementing 
Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition using MATLAB, 
leveraging machine learning techniques and masks to 
improve accuracy and robustness.  The objective of this 
project is to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning 
algorithms for traffic sign detection and recognition, in 
combination with the use of masks in MATLAB. By 
leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to develop 
a robust and accurate system capable of detecting and 
recognizing traffic signs from images or video streams. 
Additionally, the utilization of masks helps to improve the 
localization accuracy by focusing on the relevant regions of 
interest within the image. We will explore various stages of 
the 
detection 
and recognition pipeline, including 
preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and classification. 
Moreover, we will address the challenges associated with this 
task, such as variations in lighting conditions, occlusions, and 
complex backgrounds, by implementing these techniques 
using MATLAB. 
The outcomes of this research will contribute to the 
advancement of intelligent transportation systems, efficient 
traffic management, and the development of autonomous 
vehicles. Based on the road accident statistics released by 
United states Road Safety Collaboration 1.29 million people 
are killed globally as result of road accidents. Most of the 
accidents are occurred due to drivers do not focus on the road 
by using mobile or they ignore road signs, also the weather 
may Obscures vision  especially during early morning. The 
road signs give valuable information to the control system of 
the vehicles preserve the live of the driver and the others, 
these road signs are categorized into colors to be easy for 
identification. These road signs decrease the number of 
accidents on the road. So the identification of road signs 
stands as a crucial step in mitigating traffic accidents and 
fatalities. Employing image processing technology to build 
road sign detection and recognition systems ensures that 
drivers are well-informed about road regulations and 
potential hazards, fostering the expectation of a decline in 
accidents and fatalities. The system's development contains 
two primary objectives: 1- Segmentation of road signs 
through color information extracted from real images using 
the color thresholding technique. 2-Classification of road 
signs based on the region of interest identified during the 
color segmentation stage. In this paper ,the first section is 
about sign detection, the section is about Random Forest, the 
third section is about the results of the random forest 
classifiers and the last section is about the Conclusion.
